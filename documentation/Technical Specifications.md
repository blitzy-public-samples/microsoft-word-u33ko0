## DATABASE DESIGN

Microsoft Word will use a combination of Google Cloud Firestore (a NoSQL database) for flexible document storage and Google Cloud SQL for structured data. Here's an overview of the database design:

### Google Cloud Firestore (NoSQL)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Documents] --> B[Versions]
    A --> C[Comments]
    A --> D[Collaborators]
    E[Users] --> F[Preferences]
    E --> G[RecentDocuments]
```

1. Documents Collection:
   - document_id (string)
   - title (string)
   - owner_id (string)
   - created_at (timestamp)
   - last_modified (timestamp)
   - content (string, base64 encoded)

2. Versions Subcollection:
   - version_id (string)
   - timestamp (timestamp)
   - changes (array of operations)

3. Comments Subcollection:
   - comment_id (string)
   - user_id (string)
   - content (string)
   - timestamp (timestamp)
   - resolved (boolean)

4. Users Collection:
   - user_id (string)
   - email (string)
   - display_name (string)
   - created_at (timestamp)

### Google Cloud SQL (Relational)

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ DOCUMENTS : owns
    USERS ||--o{ TEMPLATES : creates
    DOCUMENTS ||--|{ DOCUMENT_PERMISSIONS : has
    TEMPLATES ||--|{ TEMPLATE_PERMISSIONS : has

    USERS {
        string user_id
        string email
        string display_name
        timestamp created_at
    }

    DOCUMENTS {
        string document_id
        string title
        string owner_id
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp last_modified
    }

    TEMPLATES {
        string template_id
        string name
        string owner_id
        timestamp created_at
    }

    DOCUMENT_PERMISSIONS {
        string document_id
        string user_id
        string permission_level
    }

    TEMPLATE_PERMISSIONS {
        string template_id
        string user_id
        string permission_level
    }
```

This hybrid approach allows for flexible document storage in Firestore while maintaining structured relationships and efficient querying capabilities in Cloud SQL.

## API DESIGN

The Microsoft Word API will be designed as a RESTful API using Python FastAPI for the backend. Here's an overview of the main endpoints:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Gateway] --> B[/auth]
    A --> C[/documents]
    A --> D[/users]
    A --> E[/templates]
    
    B --> B1[POST /login]
    B --> B2[POST /logout]
    B --> B3[POST /refresh]
    
    C --> C1[GET /documents]
    C --> C2[POST /documents]
    C --> C3[GET /documents/{id}]
    C --> C4[PUT /documents/{id}]
    C --> C5[DELETE /documents/{id}]
    C --> C6[POST /documents/{id}/share]
    
    D --> D1[GET /users/me]
    D --> D2[PUT /users/me]
    D --> D3[GET /users/{id}/documents]
    
    E --> E1[GET /templates]
    E --> E2[POST /templates]
    E --> E3[GET /templates/{id}]
    E --> E4[PUT /templates/{id}]
    E --> E5[DELETE /templates/{id}]
```

Example API endpoint specification:

```python
@app.post("/documents", response_model=Document)
async def create_document(document: DocumentCreate, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """
    Create a new document for the authenticated user.
    """
    new_document = await document_service.create_document(document, current_user.id)
    return new_document
```

The API will use JWT for authentication and will include proper error handling, rate limiting, and documentation using FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI.

## USER INTERFACE DESIGN

The Microsoft Word user interface will be built using React with TypeScript and styled using Tailwind CSS. Here's an overview of the main components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[App] --> B[Header]
    A --> C[Toolbar]
    A --> D[DocumentCanvas]
    A --> E[Sidebar]
    A --> F[Footer]
    
    B --> B1[Logo]
    B --> B2[UserMenu]
    B --> B3[QuickAccessTools]
    
    C --> C1[FileMenu]
    C --> C2[HomeTab]
    C --> C3[InsertTab]
    C --> C4[LayoutTab]
    
    D --> D1[TextEditor]
    D --> D2[TableEditor]
    D --> D3[ImageEditor]
    
    E --> E1[StylesPanel]
    E --> E2[CommentsPanel]
    E --> E3[VersionHistoryPanel]
    
    F --> F1[StatusBar]
    F --> F2[ZoomControls]
```

Example React component using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ToolbarProps {
  onBoldClick: () => void;
  onItalicClick: () => void;
  onUnderlineClick: () => void;
}

const Toolbar: React.FC<ToolbarProps> = ({ onBoldClick, onItalicClick, onUnderlineClick }) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded-md">
      <button
        onClick={onBoldClick}
        className="px-3 py-1 bg-white rounded hover:bg-gray-200 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
      >
        <span className="font-bold">B</span>
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={onItalicClick}
        className="px-3 py-1 bg-white rounded hover:bg-gray-200 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
      >
        <span className="italic">I</span>
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={onUnderlineClick}
        className="px-3 py-1 bg-white rounded hover:bg-gray-200 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
      >
        <span className="underline">U</span>
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Toolbar;
```

The user interface will be responsive, accessible, and follow Microsoft's Fluent Design System principles while leveraging the flexibility and utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS. The use of React and TypeScript will ensure a component-based architecture with strong typing for improved maintainability and developer experience.

    User->>Frontend: Enter credentials
    Frontend->>AuthService: Send login request
    AuthService->>GoogleCloudIdentity: Authenticate user
    GoogleCloudIdentity-->>AuthService: Return authentication result
    AuthService-->>Frontend: Return JWT token
    Frontend->>Backend: API request with JWT
    Backend->>Backend: Verify JWT and check permissions
    Backend-->>Frontend: Return API response
```

The authentication flow will be implemented using React components for the frontend, with API calls to the Python backend. The backend will interface with Google Cloud Identity Platform for user authentication and token management.

## DATA SECURITY

Microsoft Word will implement comprehensive data security measures to protect sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

1. Encryption:
   - Data at rest: Use Google Cloud Storage with default encryption
   - Data in transit: Implement TLS 1.3 for all network communications

2. Data Classification:
   - Implement a data classification system (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential)
   - Apply security controls based on data classification

3. Access Controls:
   - Implement least privilege principle for data access
   - Use Google Cloud IAM for managing access to cloud resources

4. Data Masking and Anonymization:
   - Apply data masking techniques for sensitive information in non-production environments
   - Implement anonymization for data used in analytics and reporting

5. Secure Data Deletion:
   - Implement secure deletion procedures for user data and documents
   - Use Google Cloud Key Management Service for cryptographic erasure

6. Data Loss Prevention (DLP):
   - Integrate Google Cloud DLP API to detect and protect sensitive data
   - Implement content scanning for documents to prevent data leakage

### Data Security Matrix

| Data Type | Classification | Encryption | Access Control | Retention Policy |
|-----------|----------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| User Credentials | Confidential | At rest & In transit | Strict, Need-to-know | Until account deletion |
| Document Content | Internal | At rest & In transit | Role-based | User-defined, default 7 years |
| User Activity Logs | Internal | At rest | Role-based | 1 year |
| Application Configs | Confidential | At rest & In transit | Strict, Need-to-know | Lifetime of application |
